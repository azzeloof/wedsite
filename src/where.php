                        <h2>Travel</h2>
                        <p>The closest major airports are Philadelphia (PHL) and Newark (EWR) (Sergeantsville is about an hour drive from each). For international travelers, JFK is also a good option.</p>
                        <p>There's also a tiny airport in Ewing (TTN- 25 minutes from the farm). If you're flying American, you can actually book a flight through there (which is five minutes from the SpringHill Suites hotel). They operate three shuttle busses from TTN to PHL each day, and for the return trip you can even go through security and check bags at TTN. More info <a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/landline.jsp" target="blank">here</a>. Frontier also operates out of there.</p>
                        <p>The closest Amtrak station is in Trenton, about a half hour away. From New York and Newark, you can grab an NJ Transit train to Raritan Station, which is also about a half hour drive away.</p>
                        <p>There will be plenty of parking available.</p>
                        <h2>Lodging</h2>
                        <p>We've found a couple of local options, ranging from standard hotel to cozy bed & breakfasts. If you won't be traveling with a car, or prefer not to drive (ubers are few and far between), please book the SpringHill Suites and be sure to indicate on the RSVP that you'll be needing transportation. Closer, but more expensive, options can be found in Lambertville/New Hope, Frenchtown, and Stockton. Some ideas are below:</p>
                        <h4><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/RbZ32LD1qyDWwZFMA" target="blank">SpringHill Suites Ewing Princeton South</a></h4>
                        <h6><i>Room block available here</i></h6>
                        <p>A large chain hotel right next to Trenton-Mercer Airport. Relatively cheap, but not a walkable area. Transportation to/from the wedding will be provided (but only at the start/end). The room block discount code will be available in the online Guest Portal once invitations go out in July, but reach out to Adam and Sara if you need to book sooner.</p>
                        <h4><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/bL196mV7Guh4WyPr8" target="blank">Woolverton Inn (Stockton)</a></h4>
                        <p>Closest lodging option to the farm, but more expensive. There are sheep.</p>
                        <h4><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FAk1n7CK9R49bmTv8" target="blank">The Fox and the Hound (New Hope)</a></h4>
                        <p>Lambertville and New Hope are great areas to walk around, with lots of small shops and cafes. This hotel is slightly outside of the center of town but may be more reasonably priced than others in the area.</p>
                        <h4><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/8kCf8gPLeRLsDvKK7" target="blank">The National Hotel (Frenchtown)</a></h4>
                        <p>Frenchtown is a wonderful small riverside town with a record store, a couple of coffee shops, and book stores.</p>
